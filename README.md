# LivePlace

# What is this

An attempt to remake reddit's r/place in phoenix live view

# Running locally

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

# Deploying

There's fly.io things setup you should be able to `fly launch` and it work out of the box. It uses a good bit of RAM and currently making users is manual so not recommended.
